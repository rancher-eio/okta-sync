# Okta Sync

This repository contains multiple components, each with their own README.

## [eio-okta-sync](/eio-okta-sync/) - The Main Tool

If you're looking at this repository, this is probably the relevant section, if you're looking to sync things from Okta to GitHub.

## [eio-okta-client](/eio-okta-client/) - Okta Client Library and CLI

You might want this if you're just using the Okta API or want to build things that do.

## [eio-okta-data](/eio-okta-data/) - Data Types for Okta

You may want this, if you're working with Okta Data, even if you aren't using the API.

## [eio-okta-api](/eio-okta-api/) - API Types for Okta

You probably _don't_ want this, unless you're implementing your own Okta Client.
